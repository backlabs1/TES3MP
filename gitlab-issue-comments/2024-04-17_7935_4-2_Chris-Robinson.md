  restrictions (#7935)

This was a justified concern to bring up here, as it involves OpenMW's
licensing terms. If your fork removes the original license and replaces it
with one that has extra restrictions, there's an issue as you're not providing
the appropriate license for the OpenMW code you're distributing. Especially if
it wasn't clearly delineated what code is under your modified license vs
OpenMW's original license.

You didn't merely close the issue either, it was completely deleted, hiding
what was brought up and the responses. If they were causing unwarranted drama,
we'd be able to see that in the issue, but deleting it makes it look like you
had something to hide rather than them being unreasonable.
