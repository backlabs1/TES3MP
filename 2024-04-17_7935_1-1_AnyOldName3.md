Subject: Re: openmw | TES3MP has changed the license, adding additional
 restrictions (#7935)

My understanding (which could be wrong) is that something does need to
explicitly say that the TES3MP stuff is covered by the TES3MP licence and
everything else is covered by the regular GPL3, and then describe some way of
telling which licence applies to what. If that's right, it could just be an
extra couple of sentences in the readme.
