An update regarding this: the default TES3MP 0.8.1 branch was force-pushed
*without* the changes I contributed. So my changes are not there anymore. I
think this was around the same time as the [TES3MP issue
#685](https://github.com/TES3MP/TES3MP/issues/685) was deleted, but I don't
have a way to confirm that.

In this [comparison between the current TES3MP 0.8.1 branch (commit 49be5b6405
at time of posting this) and a snapshot from before the changes were
discarded](https://github.com/TES3MP/TES3MP/compare/49be5b6405d6ab427e06ed350cf76c715a1f3bdd...backlabs1:TES3MP:tes3mp-0.8.1-snapshot),
you can see that three of my merge requests were merged by "davidcernat". But
those changes have been discarded now.

I am really disappointed about this behavior. It is malicious and harmful to
the entire community.
