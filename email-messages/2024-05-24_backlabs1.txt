Hi all,

I was happy to learn that David Cernat agreed to resolve the licensing
concern by simply reverting the TES3MP license change with permission
from the other contributors.

As stated by Bret/psi29a in reply to this group on 2024-04-19:

> █ █████ ███ ██████ ██ ██████████ ███ ████ ████ ██ ████ █████ ███████
> ████ ██████ ████
> █ █████ ████ █████ ███ ██ ███ ████████████ ██ ███ █████ ██████████ ██
> ████ █████████

And as stated by Bret/psi29a in the issue #7937 description [1]:

> David has apologized and is willing to revert the commits that changed
> the licensing of TES3MP as the threat of a hostile fork from 2018 has
> long since passed.

And as indicated by the changes David Cernat authored and pushed to
TES3MP branches `0.8.1` [2] and `0.8.1-vr` [3], with commits
90a53334853ca103e13a9f42b0016816d807a844 [4] and
2344ac1c7a2a0f31c753dcc47c6e35bebfe288f3 [5], respectively, with this
commit message:

> Use regular GPLv3 license without additional terms.
>
> This change has been made with the explicit permission of the
> following people who contributed code after the additional terms had
> been added: GrimKriegor, nalal, madsbuvi, sidke, magicaldave,
> HotaruBlaze, trofi.

(You can also see these commits on my TES3MP fork on GitHub [6].)

But then on approximately 2024-05-14, the `0.8.1` [7] and `0.8.1-vr` [8]
branches were force-pushed without those two commits.

Please, what is actually going on here?

Thanks,
