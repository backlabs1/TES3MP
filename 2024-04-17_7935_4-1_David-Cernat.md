Subject: Re: openmw | TES3MP has changed the license, adding additional
 restrictions (#7935)

You've been causing more drama than is warranted by this topic and that's why
your issue was closed. Since Stanislav and I unambiguously had the right to
temporarily add the additional section 7 terms for our own code (and I
discussed that with psi29a a while before going forward with it), the question
here is whether our own code is sufficiently delimited from the "OpenMW Source
Code" through the concept of the "TES3MP Source Code" or not.

I'll go ahead and make one commit that adds clarity and settles the issue, but
this is not a matter for the OpenMW repository.
