  restrictions (#7935)

The original license was not removed. Additional terms were added that were
specified to apply to the "TES3MP Source Code". Since section 7 mentions that
such terms are applied to added material and not the original covered work,
the implication (and the reading based on the [principle of
charity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_charity)) was that they
applied to TES3MP's added material.

Every change made by TES3MP to an OpenMW source file is either between "Start
of TES3MP change" and "End of TES3MP change" or "Start of TES3MP addition" and
"End of TES3MP addition" comments.

I really cannot see a better description than unwarranted drama for this.

These license additions applying to TES3MP were discussed as early as 2018
(when Malseph forked TES3MP) and were made more than two years ago. They were
very visible and out in the open.

I didn't do something only after it was brought here. I did something after I
woke up, since it was late at night and the only activity that happened
in-between for me was sleeping for several hours.

> does come across as concerning.

I don't think this community makes even the slightest effort to avoid
drama. OpenMW project leaders have been emotionally drained by similar
dynamics in other situations.
