Dreamweave is a project adding multiplayer functionality to [OpenMW](https://github.com/OpenMW/openmw), an open-source game engine that supports playing "The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind" by Bethesda Softworks. Its source code is originally based on the TES3MP fork of OpenMW, with many modifications. Dreamweave's goal is to extend and refactor much of the core functionality of TES3MP itself. Please support the original project(s).

Project status
--------------

Being based on TES3MP's latest version, most features (and caveats) of gameplay apply to Dreamweave, with some exceptions to be documented. See the original, unmodified project status below:

[Version changelog](https://github.com/TES3MP/TES3MP/blob/master/tes3mp-changelog.md)

As of version 0.8.1, TES3MP is fully playable, providing very extensive player, NPC, world and quest synchronization, as well as state saving and loading, all of which are highly customizable via [serverside Lua scripts](https://github.com/TES3MP/CoreScripts).

Remaining gameplay problems mostly relate to AI and the fact that clientside script variables need to be placed on a synchronization whitelist to avoid packet spam.

TES3MP now also has a [VR branch](https://github.com/TES3MP/TES3MP/tree/0.8.1-vr) that combines its code with that of Mads Buvik Sandvei's [OpenMW VR](https://gitlab.com/madsbuvi/openmw).

Contributing
---------------

Helping us with documentation, bug hunting and video showcases is always greatly appreciated.

For code contributions, it's best to start out with modestly sized fixes and features and work your way up. There are so many different possible implementations of more major features – many of which would cause undesirable code or vision conflicts with OpenMW – that those should be talked over in advance with the existing developers before effort is spent on them.

Feel free to contact the [team members](https://github.com/Dreamweave-mp/dreamweave/blob/master/dreamweave-credits.md) for any questions you might have.
