That is approximately what I wrote in [my last comment in the deleted TES3MP
issue
#685](https://web.archive.org/web/20240417051934/https://github.com/TES3MP/TES3MP/issues/685#issuecomment-2060305155),
and I quoted this sentence from [GPLv3 section
7](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html#section7):

> ***If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must

There are no license-related statements at all in the files that exist only in
the TES3MP fork (I checked files in these directories: `/apps/browser`,
`/apps/master`, `/apps/openmw-mp`, `components/openmw-mp`, and `files/tes3mp`;
there are other files too that do not exist in OpenMW). There is no indication
that the TES3MP license does not apply to *all* files in the TES3MP
repository.
